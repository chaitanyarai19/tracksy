<h1 align='center'> Welcome to TrackSy :chart_with_upwards_trend: </h1>

## Inspiration :bulb:
 To ease the teachers from last minute headaches running to complete left off topics, by keeping a track of it we thought of developing a web-application that does the same .


## What it does? :gear:
Here teachers can create his/her account & add topics of the subject for the session, check off once the topics are taught, upload to-the-point class notes & important questions .

This way he/she can keep a track of the syllabus & get rid off from the last minute hustle .

## How we built it? :hammer_and_wrench:	


## Challenges we ran into 	:warning:


## Accomplishments we are proud of :woman_office_worker::technologist:
- We are proud to make this project functional and working to help our teachers in a certain manner. 
- As we have 50% of our team members who are new to this hackathon and participating for the first time, we are immensely proud of achieving a good team contribution with each of the members having contributed in the project in some way or the other. 

## What we learnt :anchor:
As a team with 50% new members, we learnt many technologies and had an experience working on it as well. Such as the GitHub and the GitHub pages were something we were introduced for the first time.

## What's next for Tracksy :rocket:
Tracksy is now all set to be teacher's most favoured go to application whenevr they need to track their curriculum syllabus. In the near future we would also integrate other facilities like attendance tracking or student's performance tracking to make teacher's work even more easier.

## Tech stack :computer:
- PHP
- GitHub
